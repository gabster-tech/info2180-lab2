                <h2>My First Virtual Training Program</h2>
                <p class="blog-info">July 3, 2021 by Gabrielle Burke</p>

                    COVID-19 or corona virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China. It then spread globally and resulted in what we are still living in — at the time of writing this — a pandemic. 
                    Vaccines have been developed, but some are still developing while the virus is mutating resulting in a few variants. 
                    I got an insane opportunity to participate in a virtual training program titled: " Variant calling + COVID-19." 
                    The organization which made this possible was Minds of Jamaica and their founder Dr Camir Ricketts in collaboration with <a href="https://milrd.org/vtp-projects/#scrnaseq-habenula-neuron">MILRD</a>. 
                    I am still so appreciative to them for opening this door.<br/>
                    Here is an example of a sample genome sequence:<br/>

                    The assigned sample was given in a fastQ file format.
                    FastQ files are often found in gzip compressed format. Each record in a FastQ file consists of four lines. Every four lines are a read entry.
                    The first line contains the metadata and gives details on the origins of the sample; information includes the sequencer number, I.D of the flow cell, lane, and the x and y coordinates on the float cell where the read is generated.
                    The second line contains the read itself, showing the nucleotide sequence. The third line begins with a plus, this acts as a placeholder so as to allow space where relevant information may be added.
                    The fourth line represents a string of quality scores encoded in ASCII characters to represent the numerical quality score.
                    We had to work with and convert other distinct types of files such as .sam, .bam and .vcf by using other types of tools like samtools and commands.
                    After performing various tasks, we were able to visualize the sample using a genome browser, authored and distributed by the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT called the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV).
                    It indicates the positions and all the nucleotide bases and sequences in addition to where mutations have occurred but not the specific type like insertion or deletion.
                    That is what we were assigned to determine. We also summarized and presented all of our findings on the last day and attend a wrap-up meeting to discuss all we had discovered, learned, and wanted clarification on.
                    I enjoyed this VTP very much. Doing it made me realize there is a field, bioinformatics/computational biology, that combines both of my passions - programming and medicine.
                    It also made me feel as though I was a part of something bigger than myself.
                    I participated enthusiastically in another one of these fantastic programs. I will blog about it in my following post.

                <h2>Lab Rats!</h2>
                <p class="blog-info">July 7, 2021 by Gabrielle Burke</p>
                
                <p>
                    Just as promised, here is my post on the second Virtual Training Program that I had the opportunity to participate in. 
                    The title of this one is "Single-cell Transcriptomics + Neuron Characterization in Habenula".
                    Admittedly, this one was a bit complex as the source, a research paper, was laced with jargon. Nevertheless, it was manageable. 
                    I had to re-read the research paper to gain a sufficient level of understanding (no complaints). I like to be challenged and embrace challenges. 
                    For this reason, well in partiality, I enjoyed this week of analyzing the habenula section of a rat's brain. FUN, FUN, FUN!
                    The habenula is a section of the brain believed to have an effect on the producers of serotonin and dopamine—our "feel good chemicals"—and that it may also contribute to depression and addiction.
                    Transcriptional profiling is the study of the comprehensive set of RNA transcripts that are made from an organism's DNA.

                    This VTP was similar to the previous one I did (read about it here), in terms of structure, so the checkpoints were assigned, the slack channel was created, and the meetings were held. 
                    I interacted with R Studio and coded in R. In addition to, visualizing the data by producing various graphs like violin, jackstraw, dot, and scatter plots. 
                    We also learned how to read and interpret them.
                    The image shows a violin plot which shows the distribution and probability density of gene clusters.  Wider sections of the violin plot represent a higher probability that members of the population will take on the given value; the skinnier sections represent a lower probability
                    At the final checkpoint where we had to identify the neuron subtypes present, I had some trouble understanding how to accurately interpret the graphs, as they were completely new to me, to present my results and findings. 
                    I received assistance from one of the mentors that were present, who directed me on how to interpret, analyze, and compare my findings. 
                    I now understand, to an extent, the types of cells that were seen and what we were looking for and how to determine the genes expressed in them.
